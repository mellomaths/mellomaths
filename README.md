- 💻 I’m currently a APIs and Microservices developer at [Sensedia](https://sensedia.com/).
- 🔭 Sometimes I'm streaming on [my channel](https://www.twitch.tv/mellomathsz) at Twitch.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Docker, Kubernetes, CI with Jenkins and other tools, microservices development using Java (Spring), Node.js and Python, and DDD.
- 🤔 I’m developing a Discord Bot for general usage. It can play music on voice channels e send interesting information as messages. See the [code](https://github.com/elis-platform).
