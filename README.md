### Hey there! 😁 

I'm Matheus Mello de Lima (_he/him_), a tech person from Rio de Janeiro that loves music and learning new things. I'm passionate about developing software that serves many people, automating processes and building solutions for engaging digital experiences. Currently I work as a Senior Software Engineer at [Wex](https://www.wexinc.com/), fighting against fraud and financial crimes.
